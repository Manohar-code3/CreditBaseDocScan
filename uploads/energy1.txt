The Role of Federated Learning in Energy ​
Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a transformative approach in the energy sector, addressing critical issues related to data privacy, ownership, and computational efficiency. ​ Traditional machine learning models often require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy risks and incurs high communication overhead. ​ FL mitigates these concerns by enabling decentralized model training across multiple clients (e.g., smart meters, distributed energy resources) while keeping the raw data localized. ​ This approach is particularly beneficial in the energy sector, where data privacy and security are paramount due to the sensitive nature of consumption profiles and operational data. ​

The Role of Federated Learning in Energy ​
Federated Learning (FL) plays a crucial role in the energy sector by enabling decentralized data processing and model training across multiple nodes, such as charging stations (CSs) in electric vehicle (EV) networks, without the need to share raw data. ​ This approach significantly enhances data privacy and reduces communication overhead. ​ In the context of energy demand prediction for EV networks, FL allows individual CSs to train local models on their data and share only the trained models or gradient information with a central server, known as the Charging Station Provider (CSP). ​ The CSP then aggregates these models to create a global model, which is sent back to the CSs for further refinement. ​ This iterative process improves the accuracy of energy demand predictions while maintaining data privacy and minimizing communication costs.
Drawbacks of Using Machine Learning in Energy

Data Privacy Concerns: Traditional machine learning methods often require centralized data collection, which can lead to privacy issues, especially when dealing with sensitive information from multiple sources. ​
Communication Overhead: Centralized approaches necessitate frequent data transfers between nodes and the central server, leading to high communication costs and potential network congestion. ​
Scalability Issues: As the number of data sources increases, the computational and storage requirements for centralized machine learning models can become prohibitive.
Bias and Imbalance: Machine learning models can suffer from biased predictions if the training data is not representative of the entire population or if there are imbalances in the dataset. ​

Methods Used

Energy Demand Learning (EDL): A centralized approach where the CSP collects data from all CSs and uses deep learning algorithms to predict energy demand. ​
Federated Energy Demand Learning (FEDL): A decentralized approach where CSs train local models and share only the trained models with the CSP, which aggregates them to form a global model. ​
Clustering-Based EDL: An enhancement to EDL and FEDL where CSs are grouped into clusters based on location or other features before applying the learning algorithms. ​ This reduces data dimensionality and improves prediction accuracy. ​

Challenges Faced

Data Heterogeneity: Variations in data quality and quantity across different CSs can affect the performance of the global model.
Model Aggregation: Efficiently aggregating local models to form a robust global model without losing important information is challenging.
Communication Latency: Ensuring timely updates and synchronization between the CSP and CSs can be difficult, especially in large networks.
Resource Constraints: Some CSs may have limited computational resources, making it challenging to implement complex machine learning algorithms locally.
