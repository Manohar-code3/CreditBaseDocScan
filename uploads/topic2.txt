I wasn’t even given a single interview until now—this is my first interview.

However, I know what happened to some of my friends, which made me fear coding interviews.

One of my friends comes from a cloud background and knows the basics of coding. In his interview, the interviewer asked him to:

    Reverse a string
    Sort an array
    Use recursion to calculate n!

He answered all the questions correctly and got selected.

Another friend comes from an ML background. In his interview, the interviewer asked about:

    Linked lists
    Reversing a linked list
    Some SQL-related questions

Unfortunately, he got rejected.

Seeing all this, I developed a fear of coding interviews and started learning properly. Now, I am good at coding.

There are many similar experiences among my friends.

The first factor in an interview is luck.
The second factor is having strong coding skills—basic coding knowledge is not enough for interviews. Without good coding skills, there is a high chance of getting rejected.
