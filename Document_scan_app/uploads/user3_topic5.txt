I am eager to join Escorts Kubota Limited (EKL) because of its pioneering work in precision agriculture, autonomous tractors, and digital farm management. EKL’s commitment to leveraging AI/ML and Computer Vision to transform the agricultural and construction industries aligns with my passion for applying technology to solve real-world challenges.

With a strong background in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Software Development, I believe I can contribute significantly to EKL’s growth. My expertise in Python, C++, and deep learning frameworks will enable me to develop robust AI models for precision farming and autonomous systems. Additionally, my experience in handling large datasets and optimizing AI pipelines can enhance the efficiency of EKL’s digital farm management solutions.

By integrating AI-driven insights into EKL’s products, I can help improve operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and enhance predictive maintenance capabilities. My problem-solving skills and ability to work in cross-functional teams will further support EKL’s innovation-driven approach.

I am excited about the opportunity to work with industry experts, gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge AI applications, and contribute to EKL’s vision of revolutionizing agriculture and construction through technology.

why courses dont help without mentor
Know I a  final year, I studing very hard. When I was in my third year (3.1), everyone around me was learning full-stack development. So, I decided to purchase a course on Udemy titled Full-Stack Development with Spring Boot and React.

However, the course lacked a proper learning path. The instructor jumped straight into coding without explaining what Spring Boot was, how to download it, or where to run it. I struggled initially, but with the help of my friends, I managed to complete the course in three months.

After completing it, I felt disappointed and thought I had wasted my time because of the mentor’s poor teaching approach. A good mentor is crucial—they should have a well-structured plan, knowing what to teach and how to teach it effectively.

For instance, if we consider a placement department, the learning process should be structured like this:

    Basics of a programming language
    Basic coding practice
    Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
    Hands-on coding with DSA

Additionally, mentors should help students prepare for interviews by conducting mock interviews, which would significantly improve their chances of securing a good job.

Having the right mentor can make a huge difference in a student's learning journey and career success.

Thank you!
