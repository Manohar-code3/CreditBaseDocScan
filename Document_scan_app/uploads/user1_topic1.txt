Know I a  final year, I studied very hard. When I was in my third year (3.1), everyone around me was learning full-stack development. So, I decided to purchase a course on Udemy titled Full-Stack Development with Spring Boot and React.

However, the course lacked a proper learning path. The instructor jumped straight into coding without explaining what Spring Boot was, how to download it, or where to run it. I struggled initially, but with the help of my friends, I managed to complete the course in three months.

After completing it, I felt disappointed and thought I had wasted my time because of the mentor’s poor teaching approach. A good mentor is crucial—they should have a well-structured plan, knowing what to teach and how to teach it effectively.

For instance, if we consider a placement department, the learning process should be structured like this:

    Basics of a programming language
    Basic coding practice
    Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
    Hands-on coding with DSA

Additionally, mentors should help students prepare for interviews by conducting mock interviews, which would significantly improve their chances of securing a good job.

Apart from this, mentors play a vital role in:
5. Providing Career Guidance – A good mentor helps students choose the right career path by guiding them on in-demand skills, industry trends, and the best learning resources.
6. Building Confidence – Many students lack confidence when starting their careers. A mentor can provide motivation, constructive feedback, and support to help them believe in their abilities.

Having the right mentor can make a huge difference in a student's learning journey and career success.

Thank you!
